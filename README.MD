# rederly-course-export
This is a set of projects for use to creating rederly course exports.

## core
[core](./core) contains core logic for creating the rederly course archive

## standalone
[standalone](./standalone) handles a database fetch and calls core, for use as a cli

## server
**TODO**  
[server](./server) opens a server to accept data to send to core. This would be the micro service approach
